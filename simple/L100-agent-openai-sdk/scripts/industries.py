"""Per-industry workshop content used by `uv run quickstart`.

Each entry holds everything that varies by industry vertical: the agent's
name and system prompt (written verbatim into agent_server/agent.py's
GENERATED block), plus the resource names the data setup notebook
(data/01_quickstart_setup.py) created for that industry. The
`genie_title_prefix`, `doc_index_name`, and `mlflow_experiment_suffix`
